1. Fast and Efficient

C programs run very quickly because the language is low-level and produces optimized machine code.
This makes C suitable for operating systems, embedded systems, and high-performance applications.

2. Low-Level Access to Memory

C lets you work directly with memory using pointers, which many high-level languages hide.
This allows fine control needed for:

hardware drivers

microcontrollers

system utilities

3. Portable Language

C code can run on many different machines with minimal changes.
This is why C is often called “write once, run anywhere” (with minor modifications).

4. Foundation of Many Modern Languages

Languages like C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Rust, Go, PHP are influenced by C.
Learning C makes it easier to understand these languages.
Function	Purpose
main()	Entry point of program
printf()	Display text and results
scanf()	Take user input
calculator() (user-made)	Perform operations
switch-case	Choose correct operator
